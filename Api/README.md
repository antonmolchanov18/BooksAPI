## <a name="about">About the project</a>

Welcome to the Book Management API documentation! This project provides a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for efficiently managing a collection of books. The implementation leverages advanced technologies, including the Python programming language, Django Rest Framework, Django framework, and a database for seamless data management.

## <a name="api">API Endpoints</a>
For effective testing of Book Management API functionality, it is recommended to use Postman, a powerful API development and testing tool. In this section, we'll provide some examples and instructions for using Postman to interact with the API.

**You can also use the provided interface of the Rest framework ( ^ Ï‰ ^)**

PK (Primary Key) and its Role in API Endpoints

In the context of API endpoints, the term "PK" refers to the Primary Key, which is a unique identifier assigned to each record in a database table. In relational databases, including those commonly used with APIs, the primary key is crucial for uniquely identifying and accessing individual records.
